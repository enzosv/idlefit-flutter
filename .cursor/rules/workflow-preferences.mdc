# Coding workflow preferences
- Focus on the areas of code relevant to the task
- Do not touch code that is unrelated to the task
- Write thorough tests for all major functionality
- Avoid making changes to the patterns and architecture of how a feature works, after it has shown to work well, unless explicitly stated
- Always think about what other methods and areas of code might be affected by code changes
- use `dart run build_runner build` to update objectbox models
- run `flutter build ios --no-codesign` to check if it builds
