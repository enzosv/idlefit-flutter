# What if's

1. calories burned was synced late

- so user misses out on offline fuel

2. double coin multiplier expired while offline

- so only part of the time should be multiplied
- must consider when timing notification

# Why not

1. exercise minutes

- active minutes not provided by google health connect as of 2025-03-15
- iPhone only doesn't measure exercise minutes
